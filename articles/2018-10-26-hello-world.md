title: Hello World - StatCoreBlog
published: true

For reasons I just wanted to have my own static site generator because there are not enough available right now. [/s](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2Fs)

Therefore I started to created my static site generator in NET Core using Razor as my template language of choice. This homepage is generated by StatCoreBlog which is the name name of my engine. I know, quite resourceful for choosing a name. The source code of the engine is right now hosted on my private git server but I will definitely publish the sources on Github.

What is missing right now?

1. No rss feed available
2. Other things

Will I implement these later on? Rss feed will be definitely available. 

I have any questions just my leave a comment. I'm just kidding....
